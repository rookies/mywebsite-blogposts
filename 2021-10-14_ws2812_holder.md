For my ShotBot project (more on that hopefully soon) I needed a holder for a WS2812 module ---
so I designed one with FreeCAD and 3D-printed it.

You can find the files on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5021343) and in the
ShotBot GitHub repository. It fits modules with a size of UNIT(54x10,mm) and two UNIT(3,mm) holes
at a center-to-center distance of UNIT(26,mm), but if you have a module with different dimensions
you can modify the design in FreeCAD.

The module snaps nicely into place, for extra security you might want to add two drops of glue at
the hole positions. Here are some photos of the part used in the ShotBot UI module:
