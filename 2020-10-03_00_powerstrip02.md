Time for an update on the Arduino-controlled power strip! In the last post I
described how I built the front plate with the outlets and did a bit of
wiring---in this post we will do more of that and be able to even test it
for the first time.

First, I cut the UNIT(220x220,mm) back plate from UNIT(12,mm) plywood and
four UNIT(60,mm) pieces of UNIT(15,mm) aluminum square profile. You don't
need fancy tools for that, a small "Puk Saw" as shown in the picture works
fine. I used thicker wood than for the front plate to be able to screw into
it more easily for mounting stuff.

Then I drilled one UNIT(6.5,mm) diameter UNIT(8,mm) deep hole in each of the
four corners of the back plate and screwed in M4 threaded inserts.

To connect the front plate with the back plate, I used M4 threaded rod, from
which I cut four UNIT(78,mm) pieces, together with cap nuts. You can also use
simple screws, but I had the threaded rod and the cap nuts lying around from
another project so I used that.

After drilling matching UNIT(4,mm) holes in the front plate, I connected it
to the back plate using the threaded rods and aluminum profiles as spacers.
It's starting to take shape...

After this first test fitting I took it back apart and mounted the relay
module to the back plate using a 3D-printed holder and UNIT(3x16,mm) wood
screws. The OpenSCAD file for the holder is on
[GitHub](https://github.com/rookies/arduino-powerstrip/blob/master/3dprints/relay_module_holder.scad),
but simple spacers should work fine, too. I have a 3D printer sitting on my
bench, so I'm always searching for excuses to use it...

To be able to mount the power input connector, I then cut the first
UNIT(235x80,mm) side panel from UNIT(6,mm) plywood, drilled UNIT(3,mm) holes
UNIT(15x20,mm) from the edge for mounting screws, and transferred them to the
aluminum profiles.

I then mounted the aluminum extrusions to the side panel using UNIT(10,mm)
M3 screws and nuts, which was a bit tricky because of the tight space. The
weird grabber tool you see on the picture was very helpful to hold the nuts.

After sawing a hole for the power input connector using a scroll saw and
drilling two UNIT(3,mm) holes, I was able to mount the connector using
UNIT(12,mm) M3 screws and nuts.

With the power connector mounted, I finished the "high voltage" wiring by
connecting the neutral and ground from the connector to the outlets, the
live connection from the connector to the relay board, and the relay board
outputs to the outlets.

After screwing the top plate and the back plate together again, I just had
to connect an Arduino Nano and was able to test it for the first time.
And... it didn't work. Turns out you need to supply the opto-isolators with
UNIT(5,V) and the relays with UNIT(12,V)---it won't work if you supply
UNIT(12,V) to both.

After I figured that out, everything worked like a charm. The software is
still in development, but already on GitHub. More on that in a later post!
