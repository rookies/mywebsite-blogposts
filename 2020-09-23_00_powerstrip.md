My desk is a mess. When I built it I wanted to be able to switch every device
on and off at a central location, so I bought a power strip with lots of
switches and ran wires from there. Initially that worked fine, but with an
increasing number of devices on and around my desk the mess started to
increase as well. To solve this problem for now and (hopefully) forever,
I want to build a power strip where each outlet is controlled individually by
an Arduino. This allows me to run a single power line to the power strip from
any outlet in the room while I'm still able to control every outlet from my
desk and, if everything works as planned, even via network from everywhere
else.

Let's start with the "high voltage" side, the main components of which are a
connector for the power cord, a relay module with eight channels, and eight
power outlets. To protect the components, I use a connector with an
integrated fuse holder and a UNIT(10,A) fuse because the relays and the
connector are rated for this current. Everything is wired together using
stranded wire, wire connectors, and ferrules.

For the assembly, I started by making the front plate out of UNIT(6,mm)
plywood. I cut it to size, which I chose as UNIT(220x220,mm), and laid
out eight holes in two rows for the outlets. I also wanted to be smart
and marked the positions of the screw holes with dividers and a square
-- nice try, but that didn't quite work out as we will see later...

With a UNIT(44,mm) hole saw, I drilled out the holes for the outlets and with
a UNIT(4,mm) drill the holes for the screws. Instead of using my marked
positions I just placed the outlets into the holes, aligned them by eye, and
then marked the hole positions with a UNIT(4.5,mm) drill through the holes of
the outlets. This worked pretty well and as you can see my previous markings
weren't quite at the right position, so this method was definitely the better
choice. You should also use a backer board when drilling the holes to avoid
tear-out, that didn't avoid it completely in my case but I'm sure it helped.

Then I inserted the outlets, screwed them in place temporarily (of course I
forgot to buy screws of the right size...), and wired neutral and ground in
groups of four outlets together.

I then did the same thing with the inputs of the eight relays.

The wire connectors will later be connected to the power input
connector---that's why there's one free connection in the center of each
connector---but
that has to wait until the enclosure is finished and I know how long the
wires need to be. The same is true for the wires connecting the outputs of
the relays to the live terminal of the outlets. But that's it for this post,
stay tuned for updates.
